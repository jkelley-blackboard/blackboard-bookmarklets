# Blackboard Bookmarklets

A collection of **experimental bookmarklets** designed to help Blackboard Learn administrators and support teams streamline workflows.  
These lightweight tools can be added to your browser bookmarks and run directly from any Blackboard page.

## üåê Live Bookmarklet Page
The easiest way to access and install the bookmarklets is via the **live index page**:

**[‚û° Blackboard Bookmarklet Launcher](https://jkelley-blackboard.github.io/blackboard-bookmarklets/docs/index.html)**

From there, you can drag and drop bookmarklet buttons into your bookmarks bar.

## üìñ What Are Bookmarklets?

A **bookmarklet** is a small JavaScript program stored as a browser bookmark.  
When clicked, it executes directly in the context of the page you're viewing.

> **Why use bookmarklets?**  
> - No installation required.
> - No browser extensions or special permissions needed.
> - Easy to share and maintain.
