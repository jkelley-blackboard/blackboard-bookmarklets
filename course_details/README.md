# Blackboard Course Info Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet provides a lightweight way to fetch and view REST API data for courses directly from the **Admin > Courses > Courses** page in Blackboard Learn.  
It overlays small 🛈 icons next to each listed course, allowing you to quickly inspect or copy key details (e.g., ID, UUID, Ultra status, term, availability).

## 🔍 REST API Endpoint

The bookmarklet calls:

```

/learn/api/public/v3/courses/courseId:{COURSE_ID}

```

and requests these fields:

```

id, uuid, externalId, courseId, name, description, created, modified,
ultraStatus, organization, allowGuests, allowObservers, closedComplete,
termId, availability, enrollment, locale, externalAccessUrl

```

## 🧱 Technical Notes

- Works within the `bb-base-admin-iframe` context  
- Requires access to the public REST API (`/learn/api/public/v3`)  
- Non-destructive — read-only API calls only  
- Tested in Chrome, compatible with current Learn SaaS builds  
- Includes error handling for missing iframe, invalid page, or blocked fetch

---

## 🧹 Clearing Injected Elements

Click the “**Clear Icons**” button at the top-right corner of the iframe to:
- Remove all 🛈 icons  
- Clear the cache  
- Remove the cleanup button itself

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Must be run on the `/webapps/blackboard/execute/courseManager` page  
- Requires appropriate admin REST API access  
- Doesn’t paginate across multiple result pages (each page run separately)
